# AtliQ_Mart_Supply_Chain_Analysis
Overview
AtliQ Mart, an FMCG manufacturer in Gujarat, India, faced challenges with key customers discontinuing contracts due to persistent late deliveries (58.9% on-time vs. 86% target) and incomplete orders (53.6% in-full vs. 76.5% target). This project aims to identify root causes, analyze key supply chain metrics, and propose actionable solutions to improve delivery performance and inventory management.

Problem Statement
Key Issue: Loss of key customers due to service failures (late/incomplete deliveries).

Root Causes:

Low Line Fill Rate (LIFR: 65–68%) causing frequent stockouts.

High Volume Fill Rate (VOFR: ~96.7%) but inconsistent with LIFR, leading to incomplete orders.

Average delivery delays of 1.66–1.72 days.

Key Metrics Analyzed
On-Time (OT) Delivery: 58.9% (vs. 86% target).

In-Full (IF) Delivery: 53.6% (vs. 76.5% target).

OTIF% (On-Time In-Full): Critical gap impacting customer satisfaction.

Line Fill Rate (LIFR): 65–68%, indicating frequent stockouts.

Volume Fill Rate (VOFR): ~96.7%, showing strong volume fulfillment but incomplete orders.

Tools Used
Data Analysis: Power BI, Excel, SQL.

Data Visualization: Tableau.

Automation & Scripting: Python.

Key Insights
Inventory Gaps: Low LIFR (65–68%) caused frequent stockouts of essential products like AM Milk 500.

Delivery Delays: Average delay of 1.66–1.72 days contributed to low OT%.

Data Inconsistencies: Invalid metrics (e.g., OTIF% >100%) highlighted the need for data cleanup.

Recommendations
Improve Inventory Management: Increase LIFR by 15% through dynamic replenishment strategies.

Optimize Logistics: Reduce delivery delays by 1.2 days through better carrier partnerships and routing.

Enhance Data Accuracy: Automate data workflows to eliminate reporting errors and improve forecasting.

Expected Outcomes
Improve OTIF% by 25% within six months.

Reduce delivery delays by 1.2 days.

Increase customer retention and support expansion to new metro/Tier 1 cities.
